    <p>
        <img float="left" class="profile-pic" src="/media/profile_pic.jpg">
        I'm a software engineer currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Real-Time Interactive Simulation at <a href=https://www.digipen.edu>DigiPen Institute of Technology</a>.
        I've worked on academic project teams of 8-12 people creating video games in custom game engines written in C++.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most of my project experience is in tools programming, although I have some knowledge of core engine and graphics programming.
        I enjoy diving into a codebase and figuring out how to write tools that work with the existing code.
        Currently I am working on an <a href="http://nickammann.com/projects/">editor</a> for a custom 3D game engine called YTE.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lately, I have taken an interest in UI/UX design. I am developing a <a href="http://nickammann.com/projects/">GUI for Perforce</a>, targeted towards game developers that might benefit from a directed source control workflow.

    <p>I designed this theme from the ground up for <a href=http://www.ezrasavard.com>my own website</a> and had some inspiration from the <a href=http://the-development.github.io/flex />Flex Jekyll Theme</a> (fonts!) and <a href=http://lisesavard.com />Lise Savard's Blog</a>.</p>
    <p>Ezora uses a fairly minimal set of layouts and sass, and will automatically conform to a sensible layout based on the YAML provided, unless a layout is specified. Width/height values are all defined in the top of main.scss as variables, so you don't have to hunt too far through the SCSS to tweak things.</p>
    <p>The default layout handles the home page and any other pages while the post layout extends the default slightly to include a date-stamp at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>Notable _includes are the shiny and responsive topbar, included in the default layout, and the postlist, which is a paginated pile of posts you can include in any page, like the default home page does. You can specify your navigation menu links in topbar.</p>
