I joined the Azure Media Services Infrastructure team at Microsoft in 2019 with the goal of supporting the various teams under Azure Media Services. My responsibilities consist mainly of improving internal services to support fellow developers and constructing processes for production-scale resource buildout. Part of the infrastructure workload is also investigating the feasibility of new technologies for both customer and internal services.

Before joining Microsoft, I spent 3 months as an intern with the Developer Tools team at Magic Leap, helping to diagnose problems with the workflow for augmented reality app developers who would be using the suite of custom tools.

I graduated from [DigiPen Institute of Technology](https://www.digipen.edu) with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Real-Time Interactive Simulation.
Much of my time at DigiPen was spent working on academic project teams of 8-12 people creating video games in custom game engines written in C++.

Most of my academic project experience is in tools programming, although I have some knowledge of core engine and graphics programming.
I enjoy diving into a codebase and figuring out how to write tools that work with the existing code.

As a side project, I began developing a [graphics framework](https://github.com/nicholasammann/elba) targeting image processing and real-time post-processing effects.
