<h1 class="top-text">About Me</h1>

<p>
    <img class="profile-pic" src="/media/profile_pic.jpg">
    I am a software engineer currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Real-Time Interactive Simulation at [DigiPen Institute of Technology]<https://www.digipen.edu>.
    I've worked on academic project teams of 8-12 people creating video games in custom game engines written in C++.
</p>

<p>
    Most of my project experience is in tools programming, although I have some knowledge of core engine and graphics programming.
    I enjoy diving into a codebase and figuring out how to write tools that work with the existing code.
    Currently, I am working on a [narrative-focused mystery/horror game]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPV8HeLMVfY> in Unreal 4 with a team of artists, designers, and programmers.
    I am also developing a [graphics framework]<https://github.com/nicholasammann/elba>, which I am using to explore image processing and real-time post-processing effects.

    Lately, I have taken an interest in UI/UX design. I am developing a <a href="http://nickammann.com/">GUI for Perforce</a>, targeted towards game developers that might benefit from a directed source control workflow.
