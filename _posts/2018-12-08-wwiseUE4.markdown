An introduction to integrating a Wwise project with an Unreal 4 project, covering: how to generate soundbanks in Wwise and Unreal, our options in regards to playing sounds in-engine (and why we choose one option over the other), how to set Wwise parameters and states, and how to fix some common bugs.

The game being used in this example is an academic project, Takowana County, for which I did audio implementation. The corresponding Wwise project created by the audio team is the subject of any Wwise-related screenshots.

This guide assumes you have a Wwise project available for use, but not much experience with Wwise or Unreal. Wwise 2018 and Unreal 4.20 were used for this project.

## Generating Soundbanks

After opening up the Wwise project, navigate to the Designer layout scheme via Layouts > Designer on the menu bar. You should see the Project Explorer window (shown below) - if not, try finding it in View > Project Explorer.
